        <h1>Ribby and Croaks</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Ribby and Croaks are a boss duo in Cuphead. They are fought and encountered in the level Clip Joint
                Calamity on Inkwell Isle One. Although they are separate during the first two phases of the fight, they
                still share the same health pool.</p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>The duo seem to be wood frogs, but Croaks is a brown frog with a light salmon underside and he wears a
                maroon belt, brown boxing gloves and red pants/leggings. Ribby is a green frog who is shorter than
                Croaks, and has a yellowish white underside. He wears red boxing gloves, a red belt and white
                pants/leggings.</p>

            <h2>Battle</h2>
            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Before the battle, Croaks makes a taunt followed by Ribby, who snarls at Cuphead and Mugman with shaky
                legs.</p>

                —Ribby and Croaks, Phase 1 Death Screen<br>
                <br>
                In the first phase, the two frogs take turns attacking the players in a set pattern that is easily
                memorized and avoided:<br>
                <br>
                - Croaks will spit out fireflies, which are literally on fire, that will slowly inch closer to damage
                the
                players. These bugs are easily disposable by simply shooting at them. Because of this, Croaks' attack is
                much easier to avoid than Ribby's. Hitpoints = 4/4/4 <br>
                <br>
                - Ribby throws fist shaped energy waves at the player in a set pattern, some of which can be parried:
                one
                close to the ground, one slightly higher off the ground and one high off the ground. The pattern
                reverses after the third energy fist. The entire pattern (including the reversion) is shot twice. In
                Simple and Expert mode, however, the pattern is shot once, with decreased speed in Simple mode, and
                increased speed in Expert mode.<br>
                <br>
                In Expert mode, both Ribby and Croaks do their attacks in unison, rather than individually.

                "Crude and bad, 'cause we're from the wrong side of the lily pad."<br>
                —Ribby and Croaks, Phase 2 Death Screen<br>
                <br>
                In this phase, players are now surrounded by Ribby and Croaks in a pincer attack, with Ribby on the left
                and Croaks on the right. They will now attack simultaneously, although Croaks' attack is a little bit
                longer than Ribby's.<br>
                <br>
                Ribby will periodically slap three ringed ball-like projectiles bouncing up and down, while Croaks will
                spin his body rapidly like a fan, blowing the players away from him and towards Ribby's attack in order
                to damage them. In Expert mode, the ringed balls bounce faster, and Croaks blows the players away with
                more force. Ribby's attack can be avoided by running away from it as it bounces, dashing or
                smoke-dashing away, even while being blown away.<br>
                <br>
                In Simple and Expert mode, Ribby will be throwing energy waves like in the first phase after rolling.
                However, the pattern doesn't reverse after the third energy fist like it does in the first phase.
                Instead, it simply ends. He will then alternate between throwing energy wave punches and slapping ringed
                balls, of which he can also choose to slap either once, twice or thrice.<br>
                <br>
                Ribby and Croaks working together by combining attacks.<br>
                <br>
                After taking enough damage, Croaks will open his mouth and Ribby will attempt to damage the players
                again by rolling at Croaks. After that, Ribby will then roll into Croaks' mouth, making Croaks swallow
                Ribby and causing Croaks to transform into a slot machine. This commences the final phase of the battle.
                In Simple mode, the battle will simply end with Croaks pounding his fists to the floor, and Ribby
                crying. Hitpoints = 854/714/741

                —Ribby and Croaks, Phase 3 Death Screen<br>
                <br>
                In this phase, the giant slot machine is initially invulnerable and will spew coins continually. In
                expert mode, coins are fired more frequently.<br>
                <br>
                A slot machine formed by Ribby and Croaks fusing.<br>
                <br>
                By triggering the crank via a parry (which does not count toward the parry total), the machine will turn
                vulnerable and cycle through different symbol patterns to indicate its impending attack. It will open a
                giant metal hatch in its bottom half which shoots out moving platforms with various properties, all of
                them have spikes on the side and deal contact damage, the spawn rate will slowly increases as well.
                There are three possible set of chip platforms that can be spawned:<br>
                <br>
                Tiger: Orange chips that make orange balls bouncing up and down out of the center, which must be jumped
                over or went under to not get hit. The bounces are always in a pattern, even if the chips start to spawn
                faster.<br>
                Snake: Green chips that need to be jumped on continuously to not get hit by the side, the speed of the
                chips keeps accelerating.<br>
                Bull: Red chips that float in the middle of the screen before shooting fire jets in an indicated
                direction.<br>
                In Expert mode, all the platforms spawn and move faster.<br>
                <br>
                When sufficient damage has been dealt to the slot machine, it malfunctions and and violently rumbles,
                with skull icons on its body and crossed out eyes. Hitpoints = 578/665
