        <div id="botanic">
            <p>The Root Pack is a group of four root vegetables residing on Inkwell Isle One, and the boss of the
                Botanic Panic! level.</p>

                Spudder is a potato, Ollie Bulb is an onion with a big purple nose, and Chauncey Chantenay is a
                carrot with forehead creases that hide his third eye. All of these root vegetables are rather large
                compared to Cuphead and Mugman. The last member is Horace Radiche, a radish with tall leaves, purple
                nose and eyebrows, green sclera, sharp teeth, and brown arms.

            <h2>Battle</h2>
            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Sal Spudder bursts out of the ground with an angry expression on his face, looking towards the player(s).
                He quickly resumes his idle animation as the fight commences. It was originally planned for Sal to have
                a voice when emerging, but the idea was later scrapped.</p>

                —Sal Spudder, Death Screen

                After his intro, Sal Spudder will begin an attack pattern involving him spitting out three dirtballs,
                and
                then a knotted worm that the player can parry. Sal will spit out his projectiles faster every round of
                his
                attack, eventually going back to the starting pace. In Simple mode, he spits two dirtballs instead of
                three
                before the worm. His projectiles are also slower, and they are fired at a slower rate. In Expert mode,
                the
                projectiles are fired at a faster rate and move much faster.

                "Hey little guy, it's O.K. if you have to cry!"
                —Ollie Bulb, Death Screen

                After Sal Spudder has retreated into the ground, Ollie Bulb will emerge out of the ground in the middle
                of
                the stage and look around. If the player attacks him, he starts to cry, with his tears coming down at
                different intervals. All the player has to do is dodge the tears by moving left and right. There may
                also be
                pink tears that can be parried. In Expert mode, the tears drop quicker and there will be more falling
                each
                time he cries. In Simple mode, Ollie is skipped after defeating Sal Spudder, and the fight goes straight
                to
                phase 3. If you do not shoot him, he will retreat to the ground but another mini-boss will appear in the
                next phase.

                —Chauncey Chantenay, Death Screen

                After Ollie Bulb disappears, Chauncey Chantenay emerges into the background in a showy manner, and
                proceeds
                to rub his head to telepathically summon carrots from the background that home in on the player(s).
                These
                carrots can be destroyed (Hitpoints = 4/4/4). In Simple mode, there will be less homing carrots. The
                carrots
                will also be slower, less accurate in their homing, and have a longer wait time before starting to home
                in.
                In Expert mode, there will be more homing carrots. They will be faster, more accurate, and have a
                shorter
                wait time before starting to home in. Occasionally, Chauncey will open his third eye and fire three
                laser
                beams at the player(s). In Simple mode, the laser will be slower, and there will only be two beams. In
                Expert mode, the laser will be faster, but there will only be two beams. After he fires these beams, he
                resumes his regular attack of summoning homing carrots.

                If the player(s) chooses not to attack Ollie Bulb while he looks around, he will not cry to attack, but
                instead realizes you are not hurting him and leaves happily. As Ollie leaves, Horace Radiche jumps out
                with an angry expression and start to spin around shortly after his intro, chasing the player(s) around
                like Sally Stageplay's parasol. The player(s) would have to jump over him to dodge him. He pairs up with
                Chauncey Chantenay acting as another obstacle in the final phase. When he is defeated, he will be dazed
                and stop spinning and explode into pieces.
                If the player dies in the secret phase, the progress bar will be obscured, just like the secret phases
                that appear in other bosses.
