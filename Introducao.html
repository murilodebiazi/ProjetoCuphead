            <p>Cuphead is a run and gun indie video game developed and published by StudioMDHR. First announced in 2013,
                the game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One in September 29th, 2017, for macOS in October
                19th,
                2018, for Nintendo Switch in April 18th, 2019, and for PlayStation 4 in July 28th, 2020. The game was
                inspired by the rubber hose style of animation used in cartoons of the 1930s, such as the work of
                studios
                Fleischer and Walt Disney Animation, and seeks to emulate their subversive and surrealist qualities.
                Cuphead
                features one or two players taking control of animated characters Cuphead and his brother Mugman to
                fight
                through several levels that culminate in boss fights as to repay their debt to The Devil. The game was
                praised for its art style and noted for its challenging difficulty. It was both a critical and
                commercial
                success, winning several awards and selling over four million copies by July 2019. An animated series
                based
                on the game, entitled The Cuphead Show!, is on Netflix.</p>

                is the titular main protagonist of the video game of the same name. Cuphead is Mugman's
                irresponsible older twin brother and like the rest of his family, lives on Inkwell Isle. He is usually
                played by the first player and as a result, was the default character for Player One before the update
                in April 2019, after which the first player can choose whether to play as him or Mugman.</p>

                is the deuteragonist of Cuphead. Mugman is Cuphead's sensible younger twin brother and like the
                rest of his family, lives on Inkwell Isle. He is controlled by the second player and can join or leave
                the game at any time. Due to his deuteragonistic role, Mugman formerly could not be controlled by the
                first player. However, as of the update in April 2019, the first player can choose to play as Mugman
                instead of Cuphead, making it so that Mugman won't have to be controlled by the second player.</p>

                is the main antagonist and final boss of Cuphead as well as the overarching antagonist of its
                DLC, The Delicious Last Course. As ruler of the underground region of Inkwell Hell, he resides within
                the colossal and castle-like casino that takes up most of its landscape.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            On the fictional Inkwell Isles, Cuphead and his brother Mugman are two fun-loving kids who live under the
            watchful eye of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the brothers enter the Devil's Casino and begin
            playing craps. When they go on a winning streak, the Devil himself offers to raise the stakes. If Cuphead
            and Mugman can win one more roll, they will receive all the money in the casino; if not, the Devil will take
            their souls. Cuphead loses by rolling snake eyes, and he and Mugman beg for mercy. The Devil makes a deal
            with them: collect the "soul contracts" that signify his ownership of the souls of his runaway debtors by
            midnight the next day, and he might let them keep theirs. They visit Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion
            that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest, but also warns them the debtors
            may change themselves to different things in attempt to stop them.<br>
            <br>
            The brothers travel around the Inkwell Isles, fighting the residents who have lost their souls to the Devil
            in order to obtain their contracts. On entering the second island, the Elder Kettle informs them about
            "doing the right thing" when they come up against the Devil again. Once they have the contracts, they return
            to the Devil's Casino, but its manager King Dice blocks their way. He has lost a bet with the Devil,
            presumably over whether Cuphead and Mugman would be able to complete their task, and forces them to fight
            his own henchmen before confronting them directly. After the brothers defeat King Dice, the Devil demands
            that they hand over the contracts in exchange for "joining his team". What happens next depends on the
            choice of the player. If the player decides to do so, the Devil turns Cuphead and Mugman into his demonic
            lackeys and the game ends. If the player declines, the Devil becomes furious at the brothers' refusal to
            honor their deal and fights them himself. Cuphead and Mugman triumph over him, burn the contracts, and race
            home. Learning that they no longer have anything to fear from the Devil, the former debtors honor the
            brothers for their heroic actions.
