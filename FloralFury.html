        <h1>Cagney Carnation</h1>
        <div id="caney">
            <p>Cagney Carnation is the boss of the level titled Floral Fury. He is one of the bosses that can be
                encountered in Inkwell Isle One.</p>
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Cagney Carnation, like his last name implies, is a tall, sentient carnation flower.

                At first, Cagney seems like an innocent-looking flower with a stamen as a face, orange cheeks, a small,
                pointed nose, six orange petals, each with stripes of a darker shade of orange on the tips, large leaves
                that act like hands, and a dark green stem with four light green leaves on the bottom.

                However, shortly after, Cagney's stem grows small yellow thorns, his petals get a pointed tip in the
                middle of each of them, his orange cheeks completely disappear, his nose gets longer, his eyes become
                larger, and his leaves turn into long arms with actual hands.

                In his final phase, Cagney will have his hands planted into the ground (presumably absorbing the
                nutrients from the ground to make himself stronger), and his usually round teeth and petals will have a
                sharper shape, his stem gets much larger, and he seems to have vines come out of his bottom petal</p>

            <h2>Battle</h2>
            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Cagney smiles at the player(s) in an innocent way before suddenly roaring/yelling at them. He then begins
                his characteristic dancing idle animation as the battle begins.</p>

                Phase 1
                CagneyIcon1
                At the start of the battle, Cagney is capable of using three different attacks.

                Lunging Lurk-He extends both his face and his arms as a lunge to quickly lash out and deal damage. To
                avoid this attack, players must either jump on the platforms or get off of them, depending on which
                section Cagney is aiming for. In Expert Mode, he lunges after much less of a delay.
                Magic Hands-His stem splits into a pair of legs and he cups his hands together, opening up to shoot
                either:
                One sycamore seed with eyes that will fly like a boomerang across the screen over the flying platforms,
                then fly back across under the platforms.
                Three flying acorns that will be shot out from top to bottom, moving toward where the player(s) was.
                He can chain three attacks at most before going back to idle animation. This attack is referred to as
                "Magic Hands" because the action he is doing is similar to showing a magic trick, and glitters shines
                when he opens his "hands". In Simple Mode, he can only chain two attacks at most, and the acorns and the
                sycamore seed fly slower. In Expert Mode, there will be four acorns, and both the acorns and the
                sycamore seed fly much faster.
                Gatling Seed Plant-He morphs his face into a Gatling gun to shoot different colored seeds. Each seed has
                different abilities:
                Blue Seed - This seed grows a vine and then releases a green Toothy Terror Chaser that acts like a
                homing missile. In Simple Mode, they spawn slower, turn and travel slower. In Expert Mode, they spawn,
                turn and travel faster. Hitpoints = 4/4/10
                Purple Seed - This seed grows a Baby Toothy Terror on the ground that acts like an obstacle. In Expert
                Mode, Cagney will never shoot purple seeds. Hitpoints = 5/5/8
                Pink Seed - This seed grows a vine and then a Toothy Terror Floater that will fly above. It then opens
                its mouth and shoots a seed at the player(s). Only one can be spawned at maximum and any excess pink
                seed will turn into a green Toothy Terror. The seed itself and the flower's bullets can be parried. The
                Toothy Terror cannot be damaged until it is in its attacking animation. In Simple Mode, the pink bullet
                travels slower. In Expert Mode, two of this kind can be spawned at maximum, but the chances are slim.
                Hitpoints = 3/4/4
                In Simple Mode, the seeds fall slower.

                In each difficulty, all of his attacks are divided into sub-phases a lot more pronounced than most
                bosses in this game.

                In Normal Mode, he initially alternates between the lunging and Gatling gun attacks. After a damage
                threshold, he begins to use the “Magic Hands” attack before alternating between it and the lunging
                attack. After a second damage threshold, he will go back to using the Gatling gun attack before
                alternating between it and the “Magic Hands” attack.
                In Simple Mode, he initially only uses the lunging attack until enough damage is taken. Afterwards, he
                starts with shooting three purple seeds every time he uses the Gatling gun attack, and cycle between
                lunging and using the Gatling gun attack. After reaching a second damage threshold, he only uses the
                "Magic Hands" attack. After a third and last damage threshold, he will only use the Gatling gun attack,
                however, he will not shoot anymore purple seeds, just blue and pink seeds.
                In Expert Mode, he will only use the Gatling gun attack very rapidly at the beginning of the fight.
                After taking enough damage, he will alternate between using the "Magic Hands" attack and the lunging
                attack for the rest of this phase.
                After taking enough damage, Cagney will pull on his petals in frustration and thrusts his hands
                underground. While this happens, he undergoes a scary transformation, resembling a lion in some way. His
                petals will become sharp and more spread-out, he develops an even wider and more insane smile with
                razor-sharp teeth, his nose grows longer until the tip bends slightly upward, his eyes become slightly
                yellow, and his pupils intensely dilate. As his arms sink underground, they become thorny and sprout
                back out as spreading thorny vines that make the lower ground untouchable, forcing the protagonists to
                stay on the three flying platforms. In Simple Mode, Cagney will simply pull on his petals without
                spreading his thorny vines when defeated. Hitpoints = 1000/702/810

                Phase 2
                CagneyIcon2
                "Extreme pollination and total domination!"
                —Cagney Carnation, Phase 2 Death Screen

                Cagney will start releasing dandelions from his tongue that fly across the screen and when they come in
                contact with the player that applies a nauseous effect, and the screen will get blurry.

                At the same time, vines will grow below 1-2 of the flying platforms and then shoot upwards, briefly
                encasing them and making them impossible to stand on. In Expert Mode, the dandelions travel slower to
                stay on screen longer, with a combination of the vines on the flying platforms growing faster.

                Once Cagney enters this phase, all Toothy Terrors will disappear beside the flying orange ones, which
                will continue to shoot pink bullets at the player(s). Even if it creates more parry opportunities, it
                will be a hazard when player(s) try to jump over platforms. This will be way more apparent in Expert
                Mode if two of the Terrors are left alive at the same time.

                After taking enough damage, Cagney will be defeated, screaming to the sky and his eyes become empty
                hollow sockets. Hitpoints = 598/690
